## Challenge Overview
The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is challenging you to use your machine learning skills to develop a model capable of categorizing plant specimen images. 
Let’s explore what this means, why it matters, and how you’ll be contributing to an important real-world initiative that will help our planet!

The problem is, approximately 10% of the 40+ million database images are “non-standard.” For example, they might be images of animals instead 
of plants; or color illustrations of plants rather than actual pressed specimens. 
These non-standard images generally cannot be used as part of cutting-edge studies that aim to 
leverage machine learning to do things like train models to recognize new plant species, or predict and analyze biodiversity-related changes over time.

**Your goal is to use image classification machine learning techniques to train a model capable of distinguishing among the image classes represented in
this dataset (i.e., sorting images into classes) with a high level of accuracy. Examples of image classes 
in the dataset include: “Animal specimens”, “Biocultural specimens”, “Microscope slides” (all non-standard), and "Ordinary pressed specimens" (standard).**

The top-performing and/or most innovative model(s) produced by Break Through Tech student teams in this 
competition may be used by NYBG to create and release a free and publicly available tool via GitHub, 
which will enable plant scientists across the world to run a trained model on their raw data to filter out unwanted non-standard images
– resulting in usable datasets for conducting important biodiversity research using machine learning.
